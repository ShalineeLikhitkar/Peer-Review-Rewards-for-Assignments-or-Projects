## Project Vision
The goal of this project is to create a transparent, decentralized, and incentivized peer-review system. In educational and professional settings, peer reviews are an essential part of feedback, yet they often go unrewarded. By implementing a smart contract, this project ensures that reviewers are compensated for their valuable input, thus motivating them to provide thoughtful and constructive feedback. The vision is to promote fairness, enhance the quality of reviews, and create a sustainable, blockchain-powered feedback ecosystem.

## Key Features
- **Peer Review Submission:** Users can submit reviews for assignments or projects by rating them from 1 to 5 and adding comments.
- **Reward System:** Reviewers are rewarded with ETH based on the rating they provide, with higher ratings receiving larger rewards.
- **Claim Rewards:** Reviewers can claim their rewards for submitted reviews.
- **User Rewards Tracking:** Track accumulated rewards for each user in the contract.
- **Total Rewards Tracking:** Track the total amount of rewards distributed by the contract.
- **Withdraw Rewards:** Users can withdraw the ETH rewards they’ve earned.
- **Owner Control:** The contract owner can manage reward distribution and review processes.

## Future Improvements
